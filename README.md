# Generate-Population
i have a problem in generation a random number
this function doesnt work as i planned.

int numOfItems;
int h;
int weight;

for(int h=0;h<numOfItems;h++) {
Random rand = new Random();
int n = rand.nextDouble();
weight.add(n);
}

i need n to get me a random number based on the number of items
and the random number must be between 1 and the third of the number of items
